    "Our group is interested in the possible relationship between serve and match outcome in tennis. To conduct our analysis, we first want to be able to distinguish what makes a “good serve” by measuring aspects of the serve such as placement, speed, type, etc. If there is a measurable distinction, we hope to discover those variables and their significance to winning a point. Furthermore, through these measures we hope to see if the serve and match outcome relationship is reflected in a player’s win percentage, so we can see how important the serve is to a player’s game.\n",
    "\n",
    "We are not the first people to analyze the tennis serve, and its effects on match outcomes; however, there are some differences in their work when compared to the analyses that we want to pursue. For example, Abhinav Maddineni, Samarth Gowda, Eric Liu, and Daniel Liang performed analyses on ATP data to find out what factors (if any) affect serves, if the type of court affects a match’s outcome, and what metrics are important for analyzing the competitiveness of a tennis game.<a name=\"cite_ref-1\"></a>[<sup>1</sup>](#cite_note-1) Notably, their work focused on what factors affect the serve, like player height or court surface, and they made comparisons between winners and losers of matches by looking at various statistics. Our approach is fundamentally different because the data we have available looks at individual player statistics over the course of their entire career. Because the dataset is more granular, we hope to show how the serve affects individual success. Additionally, we seek to focus specifically on the serve and how it relates to a player's match outcomes and win percentage. \n",
    "\n",
    "In another article, we found that analyses have been performed on the probability of winning a point in men's elite tennis where the researchers found that the first serve is crucial to increase the probability of winning the point as well as the length of the rally.<a name=\"cite_ref-2\"></a>[<sup>2</sup>](#cite_note-2) The main difference between our problem and the article’s is that the article has a general focus on what comes after the serve rather than a complete focus on the performance of the serve. We believe that through the similarities of incorporating different factors in a player's serve, this aspect of the article seems the most important in helping answer our research question. \n",
    "\n",
    "Another source was considering players from multiple different groups. This research has a similar idea of looking into the correlation between serves and the overall performance of a player.<a name=\"cite_ref-3\"></a>[<sup>3</sup>](#cite_note-3)  We overlook statistics from different groups, since they compare data from all ages, skill level, and gender. While we only look at statistics from a few professional players. It is keen to note that they are looking to find the difference in serve amongst ages rather than individual success. They also noted that professionals had more success with their serves due to their experience and skills, whilst younger players struggled due to improper technique and strength.\n",
    "\n",
    "The tennis serve has also been analyzed extensively from the perspective of biomechanics. Researchers have worked on determining the factors that affect tennis serve speed by analyzing the different motions that positively and negatively affect the serve speed for tennis players across age groups.<a name=\"cite_ref-4\"></a>[<sup>4</sup>](#cite_note-4) Thus, based on their work, it seems clear that players can optimize their mechanics to improve their serve speed, and this may have an impact on their tennis game. This information is relevant to the professional players whose match data we aim to analyze because it is likely that their coaching teams use research to fine tune their serves to have every advantage possible on the court. We do not plan to analyze any data that pertains a player's swing mechanics, but it is important to keep this in mind.\n",

    "The rows of each serve chart dataset pertains to matches of a player's career. Some important variables in this dataset include unreturned serves(unret%), points won in less than 3 shots after the serve (<=3W%), placement variables like D Wide%, and break point serves like BP Wide%. These variables allow us to explore different aspects of the serve and their relation to winning a point. The variables described are all stored as floats in our cleaned and tidied datasets, and are continuous, quantitative data. These variables could help us differentiate what makes a strong serve. For example, a high unreturned serve percentage is a good indicator that a serve is \"strong\" and effective. To wrangle the data, first we webscraped the data and gathered the information off of the [tennis abstract website](https://www.tennisabstract.com/). Cleaning the data involved getting rid of any \"-\" dashes found in the dataset, and converted it into nan. We then dropped any rows with these nans to clean the data. Furthermore, to tidy the data, we added columns to make the dataset more readable for future use. We separated the match column into year, tournament, and round. We simplified the result by splitting it into just win/loss as its own column, and the opponent into another column. We also changed the datatypes from strings into floats if the data was pertaining to numbers. Lastly, we added a column to represent the surface of the tournament venue for deeper analysis. To view our wrangling and cleaning process, please view the repository for the data cleaning notebooks. \n",

    "The rows of each serve speed dataset pertains to individual matches of a player's career as well. Some important variables in this dataset include avg speed, 1st serve avg speed, speed of specific serve placement types (t, wide), and max/min speed. These variables allow us to explore aspects of the speed of the serve, allowing us to further determine if speed is an important factor to the 'strength' of a serve and if it helps a player win their points/matches. The variables described are all also stored as floats in our cleaned in tidied datasets, and are also continuous, quantitative data since the data is numeric. These variables allow us to explore even deeper as to what makes a strong serve. For example, a high/consistent average speed could be a good indicator of a strong serve. If a serve is consistently fast, it should be harder to return, but that is something that we hope to explore further and solidify. To wrangle the data, we also webscraped the data and gathered the information from the [tennis abstract website](https://www.tennisabstract.com/). Cleaning the data once again involved getting rid of \"-\" dashes found, and converted these into nan. We also dropped any rows with these nans to clean the data. To tidy this data, we added columns to make the dataset more readable again. Again, we separated the match column into year, tournament, and round. We simplified the result column into win/loss and opponent into their own columns respectively. We again changed datatypes from strings to floats if the data pertained to numbers. Lastly we added a column to show the surface of the tournament venue, also hoping this would be useful for deeper analysis. For example, we could later check if serve speed somehow differed per surface type. To view our wrangling and cleaning process, the repository has the data cleaning notebooks available.\n",
    "\n",
    "With these datasets, we could combine them into two separate datasets: one for serve chart and one for serve speed. We would just need to add a column representing who the player is at the beginning of the row. From there, we could concatenate the datasets/dataframes so that they would all be in one dataset. With these larger datasets made up of different players and their respective playstyles and serve strengths combined, we hope to have our datasets be stronger and better representative of the men's pro tennis population. \n",

Then, include your group’s expectations of one another for successful completion of your COGS108 project below. Discuss and agree on what all of your expectations are. Discuss how your team will communicate throughout the quarter and consider how you will communicate respectfully should conflicts arise. By including each member’s name above and by adding their name to the submission, you are indicating that you have read the COGS108 Team Policies, accept your team’s expectations below, and have every intention to fulfill them. These expectations are for your team’s use and benefit — they won’t be graded for their details.\n",
